# Selection Sort

> It is a sorting algorithm which selects the minimum from a given array and swaps their positions.

## Algorithm

> 1. Start from the first element of the array.
> 2. Find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array.
> 3. Swap the minimum element with the first element.
> 4. Move to the next position and repeat steps 2-3.
> 5. Continue this process until the array is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

> - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
> - Space Complexity: O(1)
