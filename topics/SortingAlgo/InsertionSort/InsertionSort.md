# Insertion Sort

> It is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm which takes an element and places it in its correct position in the sorted subarray.
> The algorithm works similar to the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

## Algorithm

> 1. Start from the second element in the array.
> 2. Compare the current element with the previous element.
> 3. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, then swap the elements.
> 4. Move the previous element one position forward.
> 5. Repeat the steps 2-4 until the end of the array.
> 6. Repeat the steps 1-5 for each element in the array.

## Complexity Analysis

> - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
> - Space Complexity: O(1)
