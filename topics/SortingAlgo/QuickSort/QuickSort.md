# Quick Sort

> Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

## Algorithm

> 1. Choose a pivot element from the array (usually the middle element).
> 2. Partition the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
> 3. Recursively apply the quicksort algorithm to the sub-arrays.
> 4. Combine the sub-arrays and the pivot to get the sorted array.

## Complexity

> - Time Complexity - O(n log n)
> - Space Complexity - O(1)
