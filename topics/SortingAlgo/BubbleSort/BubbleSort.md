# Bubble Sort

> It is a sorting algorithm which pushes the maximum number from a given array to the last by adjacent swaps.
> Also known as Sinking Sort

## Algorithm

> 1. Compare the first and second elements of the array.
> 2. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
> 3. Repeat the same process for the remaining elements of the array.
> 4. Continue this process until the array is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

> - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
> - Space Complexity: O(1)
