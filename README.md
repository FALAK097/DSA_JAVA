# Roadmap and Topics Covered

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, with a focus on interview and placement preparation. The following topics will be covered in the suggested order:

1. Introduction to Java:
   Basic syntax, data types, variables, and control flow statements
   Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation

2. Patterns: Building up the logic by solving various different patterns and also get familiar with loops

3. Arrays:
   Declaration, initialization, and manipulation of arrays
   Array operations: searching, sorting, and basic algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)

4. Strings:
   String manipulation, concatenation, and comparison
   String searching algorithms (e.g., naive pattern matching, Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm)

5. Recursion:
   Understanding recursion and recursive problem-solving techniques
   Recursive algorithms (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, and backtracking problems)

6. Linked Lists:
   Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists
   Linked list operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching

7. Stacks and Queues:
   Implementation and applications of stacks and queues
   Stack and queue operations: push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue
   Basic stack-based and queue-based algorithms

8. Trees:
   Binary trees and binary search trees
   Tree traversals: preorder, inorder, and postorder
   Tree operations: insertion, deletion, searching, and height calculation
   Balanced binary search trees (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees)

9. Graphs:
   Introduction to graphs and graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list)
   Graph traversal algorithms: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)
   Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm)
   Minimum spanning tree algorithms (e.g., Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm)

10. Sorting Algorithms:
    Comparison-based sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort
    Divide and conquer algorithms: merge sort, quicksort
    Performance analysis and understanding their time complexities

11. Searching Algorithms:
    Linear search, binary search (on sorted arrays), and interpolation search
    Hashing and hash table data structure

12. Dynamic Programming:
    Understanding dynamic programming and its basic principles
    Solving problems using dynamic programming techniques

13. Bit Manipulation:
    Understanding bitwise operators
    Solving problems involving bit manipulation

# Adding Links to Resources and Notes

This repository encourages the inclusion of external resources and personal notes to enhance the learning experience. Follow the instructions below to add links to resources and include your own notes:

1. Adding Links to Resources

To add links to external resources, follow these steps:

- Open the desired Markdown file (such as the README file) in your preferred text editor.

- Locate the section or paragraph where you want to include the link.

- Use the following syntax to create a clickable link:

[GeeksforGeeks](www.geeksforgeeks.com)

Replace Link Text with the text you want to display as the link and URL with the actual web address of the resource.

- Save the changes to the file.

# Including Personal Notes

To include your personal notes within this repository, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the appropriate folder in the repository where you want to add your notes.

- Click on the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".

- Name the file with the .md extension to indicate that it is a Markdown file (e.g., notes.md).

- Use Markdown syntax to write your notes in the file. Some formatting options you can use include:

1. Headers: Use # to create headings (e.g., # Heading 1, ## Heading 2).
2. Lists: Create unordered lists using - or \* at the beginning of each line, and ordered lists using numbers (e.g., 1., 2.).
3. Formatting: Apply bold, italic, or code formatting using \*\*, \_, and ` respectively.
4. Links: Use the link syntax mentioned earlier to create clickable links to external resources.
5. Save the file and commit the changes to the repository.

## How to contribute?

1. Fork the repository
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

## When to contribute?

1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution & make a pull request with your solution.
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file & make a pull request.

Feel free to contribute to these folders by adding your solutions, notes, or improvements. Ensure that you follow the file naming conventions and keep the folder structure organized.
